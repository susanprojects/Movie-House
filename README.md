#About The Project

Movie House

The project "Movie House" features a TV show dashboard displaying various TV shows. It is developed using VueJS.

Features:

1. The TV dashboard effectively categorizes and displays shows based on their genre. 
2. The TV shows are also sorted according to their ratings.
3. Detailed information about a particular show can be viewed by clicking on the info icon displayed for that TV show that takes you to a new page.
4. To enhance user experience, a search feature is implemented. In the dashboard, there is a search icon in the header that takes you to a page to perform the search.
5. The search is carried out by typing into the search field which triggers filtering of the grouped and sorted TV shows from the Vue store.

Built With:

# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about IDE Support for Vue in the [Vue Docs Scaling up Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support).

I chose to work with VueJS because it is the framework used at ABN AMRO.
